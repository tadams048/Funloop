        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="muted">Effective date: August 15, 2025</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Funloop LLC ("Funloop", "we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and shares information in connection with the Bamber mobile application, related websites, and services (collectively, the “Service”).</p>

        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Company: Funloop LLC</li>
          <li>App: Bamber (kid‑friendly AI conversation and learning app)</li>
          <li>Contact: <a href="mailto:privacy@funloop.com">privacy@funloop.com</a></li>
          <li>Site: <a href="https://funloop.com">funloop.com</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What We Collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Account &amp; Parent Verification</strong>: Parent email address and verification status (magic link sign‑in). Subscription status via Apple’s StoreKit (we do not receive payment card details from Apple).</li>
          <li><strong>Child Profiles</strong>: Nickname, age (or birth year mapped to age), and an avatar emoji/icon. The currently active child profile.</li>
          <li><strong>App Content &amp; Usage</strong>: Questions asked, AI responses, timestamps, and whether images were generated; minimal service analytics (e.g., app launch, mic permission, animation stall); a pseudonymous device identifier for quality diagnostics.</li>
          <li><strong>Audio, Speech, and Media</strong>: Microphone access (with your consent) for speech recognition; transcripts and prompts may be sent to AI providers to fulfill requests; voice responses are played back in the app.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide the Service (speech recognition, AI responses, text‑to‑speech playback, image generation).</li>
          <li>Set up and maintain parent sessions, verify parental consent, and manage child profiles.</li>
          <li>Synchronize content to your account with database row‑level security (RLS).</li>
          <li>Diagnose issues, measure performance, and maintain reliability.</li>
          <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Legal Bases (EEA/UK)</h2>
        <p>Where applicable, we process personal data based on contract, legitimate interests (service quality and security), consent (e.g., microphone), and legal obligations.</p>

        <h2>How We Share Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell personal information. We share data only with service providers who help us operate the Service, and only as necessary:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Apple (StoreKit)</strong> – in‑app purchases, subscriptions, and entitlements.</li>
          <li><strong>Supabase</strong> – authentication (magic link), database, and secure functions; stores parent, child profile, consent, and interaction records behind RLS.</li>
          <li><strong>OpenAI</strong> – prompts and necessary context for language model responses.</li>
          <li><strong>ElevenLabs</strong> – text used for text‑to‑speech generation and returned audio.</li>
          <li><strong>Runware</strong> – image prompts and generated image URLs for illustrations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These processors are contractually bound to protect your information and may process data in the United States or other jurisdictions. We may also disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights and users.</p>

        <h2>Children’s Privacy &amp; Parental Consent</h2>
        <p>Bamber is designed for use by children under the supervision of a parent or guardian. We require a verified parent session before a child can use the app. Parents control creation of child profiles and consent to processing. Row‑level security ensures a parent can access only their own data. If we learn that we collected personal information from a child without appropriate consent, we will delete it.</p>

        <h2>International Transfers</h2>
        <p>We and our service providers may process information in the United States and other countries. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards for cross‑border transfers.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain information for as long as needed to provide the Service and for legitimate business or legal purposes. You can request deletion of your account data (subject to applicable law and safety requirements).</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We employ technical and organizational safeguards including HTTPS in transit, access controls, and database RLS. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; we work to improve protections continually.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights &amp; Choices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or port your data, object to or restrict processing, and withdraw consent.</li>
          <li>Manage microphone permissions in device Settings.</li>
          <li>Manage subscription and billing via Apple’s App Store settings.</li>
          <li>Delete or edit child profiles inside the app (Parent‑gated settings).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cookies &amp; Tracking</h2>
        <p>The mobile app does not use third‑party advertising SDKs. Our minimal analytics are service‑oriented, not for behavioral ads. The website may use cookies for basic functionality and analytics.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. We will change the “Effective date” above and, when appropriate, notify you in the app or by email. Your continued use of the Service after changes indicates acceptance.</p>
